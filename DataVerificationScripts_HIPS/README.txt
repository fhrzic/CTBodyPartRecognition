Scripts here are done to verify results obtained on the HIPS only. It was done to asset the real performance
of the trained model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Obtain_data_for_Verification.py - script which obtains data for verification based on the exported data from
				    CTs. The data can be exported by utilizing full pipeline script. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* WidgetAnnotationScript.ipynb - script used to annotate data. It is done same like for the BCH (widgets)
			       - Input is folder obtained by Obtain_data_for_Verification.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* QuickAnnotationByInspectionScritp.py - script which allows quick annotation by separating data into three
					 subgroups. First is OK (data which is correctly predicted), Second
					 is WrongPredicted (data where image is valid, but it is wrongly
                                         predicted by the model), Third group are the Wrong (image is wrongly
                                         reconstructed due to the oblique projection)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* statistic_gigapixel.py - script which generates gigapixel image (mosaic of images) based on the lists 
			   generated by QuickAnnotationByInspectionScript.py
