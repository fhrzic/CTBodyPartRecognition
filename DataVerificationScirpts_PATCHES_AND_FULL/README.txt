Scripts for verifictaion of patches. The patches needs to be exported and then can be verified by
the scripts developed here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* LabelScript - script used to verify data. It uses openCV to show the image where annotator must decided
                if label image is correctly labeled. It also uses total segmentator output to show where 
                each label is present and its relative area. 
              - it is better to discard the label than accept it, there is plenty of fish in the segmentator
              - IT REQUIRES MANUAL IMAGE UPDATE OF THE INDEX (indexes of images being labeled must be manually entered every
                time. This is to prevent exhaustion during labeling and making custom checkpoints)

* ObtainImagesFromFolder.py - script which needs to be called prior to labeling because it acquires 
                              all necessary data.

* LabelTargetedCases_SAROS - script which selectes only targeted cases in a given range for verification
 			   - Preselected cases: ["foot", "forearm", "hand", "patella", "tarsal"]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* ObtainImagesAndXLSXFullBody_SAROS.py - Scripts which obtains full body images and xlsx files and stores them
					 in same dir appropriate for labeling by WidgetAnnotationScript.py

* WidgetAnnotationScript.ipynb - Modified script for data annotation which accepts the dir generated by
                                 ObtainImagesAndXLSXFullBody_SAROS.py
			       - Similar to script in BCH labeling script
