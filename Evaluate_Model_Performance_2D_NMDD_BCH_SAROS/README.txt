Scripts which are used to obtain predictions and thresholds for the models. There are 
several different modalities implemented such as best possible value, tolerance regarding
best possible value (find the highest threshold based on the F1 score, but also find the highest
threshold within the tolerance interval regarding F1 score)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* evaluate_outputs_NMDD_BCH_SAROS.py - script which finds best threshold or evaluates set threshold on the dataset provided
				       as xlsx file. This xlsx file can be obtained for NMDD_BCH_SAROS datasets by script
				       obtain_predictions_dl_NMDD_BCH_SAROS.py in Train_Models_2D_NMDD_BCH_SAROS dir.
                                     - This script will output statistics and thrsholds in xlsx which is important for 
                                       further evaluation. 

* evaulate_outputs_HIPS.py - script which provides complete evaluation for HIPS including generation of FN, FP, TP and TN folders for
			     each evaluated body part. Similarly to the evaluate_dl_NMDD_BCH_SAROS.py in Train_Models_2D_NMDD_BCH_SAROS
	                     dir.
         		   - Input to this script is Labeled dir generated by data verification in DataVerificationScripts_HIPS (Widgets) 
                             and path to the _threshold_xlsx (xlsx file which is obtained as a result of evaluate_outputs_NMDD_BCH_SAROS.py)
                           - Final product is indepth scores (FP, TP, TN...) and xlsx which contains all data combined similar to the
                             output of the obtain_predictions_dl_NMDD_BCH_SAROS.py in dir Train_Models_2D_NMDD_BCH_SAROS.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* export_thresholds_to_json.py - script which exctracts thresholds from the xlsx to json file. Input is xlsx generated by
                                 evaluate_outputs_NMDD_BCH_SAROS.py. 
                               - output is ".json" file with only thresholds usable and transferable much easier.
